<div align="justify">This experiment is the implementation of fibonacci series.The Fibonacci sequence first appears in the book Liber Abaci by Fibonacci,where it is used to calculate the growth of rabbit populations.This experiment involves generating a fibonacci series of the number entered by the user. The user enters a number and the program calculates its fibonacci series through recursion.First the program checks if the number is 0 it will return 0, if the number is 1 it will return 1 else it will return fib(number entered-1)+fib(number entered-2) and at this point the program starts calling itself till the function returns 0 or 1.The simulator shows the step by step representation of the the fibonacci program.</div>
