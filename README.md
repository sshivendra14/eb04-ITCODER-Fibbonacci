<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

This lab is all about the Programming Solving Approach which can used to solve real life problem.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
<div align="justify">
This experiment is basically focus on calculating the fibbonacci series of any positive interger number using Recursion concept.Recursion use data structure Stack to solve Problem.To compute the fibbonacci value/series of any number two previous value must be known in advance.To compute previous value use formula f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2).</div>

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

B.Tech Students<br>
First Year(Ist year)

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

The course is aligned to introduction of programming language to B.Tech.
